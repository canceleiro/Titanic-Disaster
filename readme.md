# Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster
### by Javier Alonso

## Installations required

The project contains a jupyter notebook, so that´s the only necessary software you´d need. Be sure to have installed on in numpy, pandas,  matplotlib and seaborn

## Project motivation

This notebook faces the project about the Titanic in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). We have data from all the passengers of the boat and information of some of them about if they died or not. Our goal is to predict if the rest survived or not

## File descriptions

The files in this project are:

- readme.md: describes the project and motivations of it

- Titanic_Disaster.ipynb.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook where all the work is done

- data.rar: the files with data of the project. Just extract them and the notebook will work perfectly

## Interactions with the project

The user must run the jupyter notebook that does the next main steps:

- Gathering Data
- Asessing and cleaning Data
- Consolidation of dataframes to files
- EDA
- Machine learning algorithm
